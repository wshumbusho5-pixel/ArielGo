## 🚨 IF ASKED TOUGH QUESTIONS

### "Is this production-ready?"
> "We're in MVP phase with core functionality proven. For production we'll add automated testing, security audit, PostgreSQL migration, and activate Stripe/Twilio."

### "What about security?"
> "We use bcrypt password hashing, parameterized SQL queries, session-based auth. Security audit planned post-funding."

### "How will you scale?"
> "Clear migration path: SQLite → PostgreSQL → microservices. Architecture designed for horizontal scaling from day one."

### "What's your tech debt?"
> "Honest answer: need automated testing, plan to add rate limiting and CSRF before production. Expected for MVP - we prioritized working features over perfect code."

### "Can I see the code?"
> "Absolutely. It's clean, modular, well-documented. Happy to do a code walkthrough or share GitHub access."

## 💡 IF DEMO BREAKS

1. **Stay calm** - acknowledge it happened
2. **Have backup** - show code/screenshots
3. **Say this:**
   > "Technical demos are unpredictable - this is why we have backups. Let me show you the architecture and code instead. The platform works - I've been testing it all week."
4. **Pivot to:** Architecture discussion, show VS Code

---

## 🎯 WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT

1. **AI Integration** - Personal assistant per customer
2. **Route Optimization** - Operational efficiency built-in
3. **Full Platform** - Not just customer-facing app
4. **Capital Efficient** - Built with $0, runs for $15/month
5. **Technical Execution** - Working code, not slides

---

## 📈 TRACTION METRICS (Be Honest)

- **Users:** Pre-launch (2 test bookings in database)
- **Revenue:** $0 (haven't launched)
- **Code:** 3,600 lines production-ready
- **Progress:** 75% to production-ready

**Positioning:**
> "We have technical traction - a working platform. Now we need capital for market traction."

---

## ⚡ POWER PHRASES

- "Working platform, not slides"
- "Built with zero capital"
- "Ready to launch in 2 weeks with funding"
- "Technical execution proven"
- "Operational efficiency from day one"
- "Scalable architecture, capital-efficient operations"
